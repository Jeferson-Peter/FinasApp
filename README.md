# FinasApp (PAC- MOBILE DEVELOPMENT)

This project was initialized with the intention of facilitating the visualization of Companies' Data, like accounting balance sheet, payroll summary,income statement and several other functionatilies... In a lighter, simpler way for data insertion and visualization, since many companies stiil use excel for certain controls, but with something like this application it would facilitate its use

# App Functionatilies
1. You can create the tables about the current month and insert de necessary data in each gap of the topics commented above automatically creating an interation with the others boards , if they have any value already inserted;
2. You can edit and delete the data if necessary, and in the end of the month, the data will be closed automatically, without any resulting modification
3. You'll have a preview of the main information as income statements, before acessing the selected month;
4. If you want,you may do the dowload of the information in file format like ".pdf", ".csv", and maybe a visualization in graphics (using the libraries that python/react-native offers);
5. If you won't use more the app, you might cancel the account with us;
6. You lose your password (don't woory about that, you can ask for a password recovery);
7. You might access an exclusive FAQ;
